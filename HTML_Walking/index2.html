<p>Crowds swarming, voices chatting, hand holding, photos taking—the center of Florence is filled with glimpses of people’s lives if you take a second to look. But unless you really sit down and observe you only get first impressions and incomplete portraits of tourists and city dwellers. Despite limited information, there are still things to observe. By taking photos of a limited set of information—legs—and removing them from their context, you are to make do with what you have, much like the fleeting glimspes and looks you see when walking through a crowd.  </p>

<p> Yet, there are still things to observe. Relationships between people—where feet are pointing and how they interact with each other. What clothing they are wearing. The care they have taken to keep their shoes clean. 

This exhibit reorients our relationship with our surroundings and the people around us, creating a new public landscape. And its something forever growing, as more people come and go. </p>

<p>So, become a part of it. Submit photos of your legs and the legs you see walking on the streets of Florence at travelerproject@gmail.com.</p>
