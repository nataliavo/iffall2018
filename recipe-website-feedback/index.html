	<h1>Recipe Website Feedback for Natalia</h1>
	<p>
	EVE: make text darker because it's hard to read; type is small for ingredients; move the top blueberry; consider taking images out; spacing is a bit awkward;line is weird with a lot of space; consistency with semicolon. </p>
	<p>LIBBY: no horizontal scrolling, makegrey darker for text, ingredients larger font size; cut down on space;look at how to correctly source things; good hierarchy </p>
