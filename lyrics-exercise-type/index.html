				<p><span class="verse">Verse</span><br>
				If this is apocalypse <br>
				Then first there was a genesis <br>
				I think I'll let myself exist <br>
				Under this bloody moon</p>

				<div class="parallax" id="three"></div>

				
				<p><span class="verse">Verse</span> <br>
				Like a moth or butterfly <br>
				I'm the queen to my demise <br>
				But don't think that I'll go amiss<br>
				I'm just getting my groove</p>


				<div class="parallax" id="four"></div>

				<p><span class="chorus">Chorus</span><br>
				But first I gotta let go of the things I tried to be<br>
				First I gotta let go of these fakers next to me<br>
				First I gotta give up everything I can't control<br>
				Get that moderation in my system and<br>
				Move on to the next<br>
				On to the next<br>
				On to the next<br>
				On to the next</p>

				<div class="parallax" id="five"></div>
				<p><span class="verse">Verse</span> <br>
				Maybe I don't know what's up<br>
				Maybe I am mostly wrong<br>
				But one thing that I know for sure<br>
				Is everywhere I go I grow</p>

				<div class="parallax" id="six"></div>

				
				<p><span class="verse">Verse</span> <br>
				Knowing me it takes some time<br>
				Diamonds are a little shy<br>
				But wait and see I'll hit some gold<br>
				And I'mma be a sight to hold</p>

				<div class="parallax" id="seven"></div>

		
				<p><span class="chorus">Chorus</span> <br>
				But first I gotta let go of the things I tried to be<br>
				First I gotta let go of these fakers next to me<br>
				First I gotta give up everything I can't control<br>
				Get that moderation in my system and<br>
				Move on to the next<br>
				But first I gotta let go of the things I tried to be<br>
				<span class="whisper">(On to the next)</span><br>
				First I gotta let go of these fakers next to me<br>
				<span class="whisper">(On to the next)</span><br>
				First I gotta give up everything I can't control<br>
				<span class="whisper">(On to the next)</span><br>
				Get that moderation in my system and<br>
				<span class="red">Move on to the next</span></p>
